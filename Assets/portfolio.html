                        <p>The Freedom of Information App is the third and final group 
                            project that my team and I built for UT Austin's Coding 
                            Bootcamp. It incorporates the full MERN Stack and was built 
                            using Bootstrap as a framework. The idea behind it was that 
                            we wanted to create an easy way for people to look up their 
                            congresspeople and learn basic information about them without 
                            the filter and spin that typically accompanies political 
                            information.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>The application functions by taking the addresss that the user 
                            inputs and running it through the Google Civics API to generate 
                            three cards and display them to the user - one for the two senators 
                            aligned to that state, and another for the representative in the 
                            House for that district. Each card has basic information about the 
                            congressperson such as their full title, phone number, social media 
                            links, and a link to view their full profile.

                        <p>When the "View Profile" button is clicked, the user is then brought to 
                            a profile page built for each congressperson that takes their name and 
                            runs it through the Google News API to bring up current news stories, 
                            the ProPublica Congress API to show bills on which they are a sponsor / 
                            co-sponsor. Additionally, a Member ID number is generated from their name 
                            and fed into the ProPublica Campaign Finance API, which then renders a pie 
                            chart via Chart.js that displays their PAC contributions vs. individual 
                            contributions on their most recent campaign. A MongoDB component also renders 
                            that allows users to leave either a like or a dislike on the politician's 
                            page that is displayed to all other users.

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <p>StrayTX is the second group project that myself and four 
                            other students worked on during the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. 
                            We were inspired to build the application because we continually 
                            see a great deal of lost pet posters and ads, and we felt that 
                            there had to be a better way to locate a lost pet. Therefore, we 
                            created a full-stack application incorporating MySQL to allow people 
                            to easily query a database of found pets in Austin to see if their pet 
                            has been found and contact the person that found them. 
                        </p>

                        <div class="text-center">
                            <img class="modal-image img-fluid" src="https://via.placeholder.com/300">
                        </div>

                        <p>When the user first opens the application, they are brought to a landing 
                            page that requires them to create an account and sign in. Once they have 
                            done that, they are brought to a home page with a search function that 
                            allows them to query our database to see if any pets matching their description 
                            have been found. Additionally, a user can save their search so they don't have 
                            to keep re-entering the search terms if they are searching for their pet over 
                            a period of time. If they find a pet that appears to be theirs, they can then 
                            click a link to see an image of the pet as well as the contact information of 
                            the person that found them.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>Part of the idea behind creating this application was to create a community 
                            that could help each other, so naturally we wanted to include a feature that 
                            would enable this. Therefore, we also created submission forms that can be 
                            accessed from the user's profile page which allow the users to submit found 
                            pet reports as well as lost pet reports. Each of these post information to the 
                            database so it can easily be found by other users who are entering the same 
                            search parameters. Beacause of this, we feel that StrayTX is the perfect way to 
                            crowd-source pet finding efforts and reunite owners with their pets.

                        <h4>Project Description</h4>
                        <p>SkyQ is the first group project that myself and a team of 
                            three other students worked on during the UT Austin Coding 
                            Bootcamp. We are all amateur stargazers, but noticed that 
                            it was difficult to find a good source of information that 
                            was simple enough to comprehend without a degree in astrophysics. 
                            Therefore, we built SkyQ to be the only tool an amateur stargazer 
                            would ever need. Complete with easy-to-read star charts, a location 
                            tracker for the International Space Station, and local weather reports, 
                            SkyQ is the perfect guide to everything that can be seen in the 
                            night sky.

                        <p>The application functions by first taking in the zip code of the user and 
                            running several API calls that use it as part of the query. First, the zip 
                            code is translated into a latitude and longitude value via the Open Street 
                            Maps API to use in bringing back the star chart that corresponds to the user's 
                            location from the Virtual Sky API. Then, the zip code is passed into the Open 
                            Weather Map API to generate the current conditions at the user's location. 
                            Finally, a separate API call runs that generates the current position of the 
                            ISS and renders it to a WebGL Earth object so that the user can easily see 
                            where it is when the page is loaded.

                        <p>This application is a simple memory game that was built 
                            using React.js. To win, the user must click on all 12 
                            the flags without clicking on any single flag more than 
                            once. It's trickier than it sounds - after every click, 
                            the flags shuffle their positions! The app also keeps 
                            score for the user and displays a message based on the 
                            user's last guess.

                        <p>The game works by first mapping over a JSON file and rendering 
                            the flags to the browser. Each flag listens for clicks, which 
                            pass its ID into an array that contains the user's previous 
                            guesses. Then, a function runs that checks to see if that ID 
                            is already being stored in the array. If it is, the user loses 
                            and the game restarts.

                        <p>If it isn't, a point is added to the user's score and a message 
                            confirms that the guess was correct. Then, a function runs that 
                            shuffles the position of the flags on the screen, and the user 
                            tries to guess again. Once the user guesses array is 12 ID's 
                            long, the game resets and the user is congratulated on winning.

                            that simulates the mechanics of an online store from the point 
                            of view of both a customer as well as a manager. Built with 
                            inquirer, it presents a variety of options to the user that 
                            allows them to affect the inventory stored in the linked MySQL 
                            database.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Customer View</h4>
                        <p>When the user starts up the bamazonCustomer.js file, the user 
                            is immediately presented with a table of the items currently 
                            for sale as well as a prompt that asks them to input the ID 
                            of the item they wish to purchase. After they enter the ID, 
                            they are then asked how many they would like to buy. If there 
                            is enough in stock_quantity to fill the order, the application 
                            shows them their total cost and asks what they would like to 
                            do next.</p>

                        <p>If there isn't, the application presents them with a message

                        <h4>Manager View</h4>
                        <p>When the user opens up the bamazonManager.js file, they are 
                            immediately presented with a prompt that allows them to select 
                            an action from a prompt (view products for sale, view low 
                            inventory, add inventory, add a new product, quit). When the 
                            user selects "View products for sale", the application queries 
                            the database to present a table of all of the items currently 
                            for sale.

                        <p>After the user is shown the table of available items, they are 
                            brought back to the main prompt and again shown their options. 
                            If the user selects "View low inventory", they are shown a table 
                            of items that have a stock_quantity of less than 5.
                        </p>

                        <p>Again, the user is brought back to the main prompt after the table 
                            is shown. If the user selects "Add inventory", they are then asked 
                            for the id of the item that they would like to restock as well as 
                            the number of units they'd like to add. Once the user provides the 
                            aforementioned values, they are then brought back to the main prompt. 
                            If the user then selects "Add new item", the prompt asks for the 
                            name of the item, the department that it should belong to, the price, 
                            and the number of units that they would like to stock.

                            for-loop is used to iterate through each of the user's answers 
                            vs. each of the existing friends' answers and find the difference 
                            between them. Finally, the application selects the friend with 
                            the least variance and sends that information to the front end,
                            where it is displayed to the user.

                            for upcoming concerts, and OMDB's API for movies. Additonally, the

                            see the command and query stored and subsequently run it through one 
                            of the aforementioned API's.

                        <p>The Restaurant Tracker is a full-stack application that allows 
                            a user to input and save a list of restaurants that they'd like 
                            to try. Once they've been to the restaurant, the user can check 
                            the restaurant off of their list, which renders the restaurant to 
                            the "Tried" section.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>The application works by first querying the database to see which 
                            restaurants are already stored under the restaurants to try section 
                            as well as the tried section and rendering those to the page. When 
                            the user clicks the "Add Restaurant" button, an on-click event runs 
                            a post request via AJAX that adds the restaurant to the database and 
                            then reloads the page.

                        <p>When the user clicks on the "Tried It" button that renders next to each 
                            restauarant in the "Restaurants to Try" section, an on-click event runs a 
                            put request via AJAX that updates the database to reflect that the restaurant 
                            has been tried, and the page reloads.

                        </div>

                        <p>As an application that follows the MVC design pattern, all of the routing is 
                            handled within the application itself. When an AJAX request is run from an 
                            on-click function, the request is routed to the controller first, where 
                            database queries that are defined in the models folder and subsequently in 
                            the ORM are stored. After the page is reloaded, any updates that were made to 
                            the database via this route are reflected dynamically.

                            user to search GIPHY's collection of GIFs via an AJAX 
                            request to the GIPHY API. The page contains several pre-built 
                            buttons that the user can click to query the collection and 
                            bring back ten GIFs that match the term on the button. The page 
                            also has an input form that allows the user to create their own 
                            buttons and searches.

                        </div>

                        <p>The application works by using a pre-built array of strings and 
                            using a for-loop to iterate over the array and dynamically generate 
                            the buttons on the page. Every time a new term is entered into the 
                            input bar, the string is trimmed and added to the array, which causes 
                            the existing buttons to clear and re-render with the new string as a 
                            button.
                        </p>

                        </div>

                        <p>When the user clicks on one of the buttons, an AJAX request containing 
                            the string on the button is made to the GIPHY API. Upon receiving the 
                            ten objects contained in the response, the application creates one GIF 
                            per object and renders it to the page along with the GIFs rating. 
                            Additionally, the GIF's static image source and animated image source 
                            are both saved as attributes of their respective GIF. However, when the 
                            GIFs are initially rendered to the page, the static image is used as the 
                            source instead of the animated one to speed up the loading time for all 
                            the GIFs. When the user clicks on a GIF, an on-click function runs that 
                            swaps out the static image source attribute with the animated image source 
                            and the GIF begins playing. To stop the GIF, a user simply clicks it again 
                            and the static source and animated source are switched.

                        <p>The Crystal Collector Game is a simple jQuery application where 
                            the user must click on images of crystals to accumulate 
                            a score that matches a random target score. However, the 
                            user doesn't know the value that each image will add to 
                            their score until they are clicked. If the user is able 
                            to match the target score, a win is added to their total 
                            and the game starts over. If the user goes over the target, 
                            a loss is added and the game resets.

                        </div>

                        <p>The game works by generating five random numbers at the 
                            start - one for each crystal, and one for the target score. 
                            Each crystal image has an on-click function attached that 
                            adds the value assigned to the crystal to the user's score 
                            and checks to see if the user has equaled or exceeded their 
                            target score. If they haven't, the game keeps moving and the 
                            user continues to try and hit the score. If the user has equaled 
                            the target score, a win is added in the wins section and the game 
                            resets and picks new numerical values. If they exceed the target 
                            score, a loss is added in the losses section and the game starts 
                            again.

                        <p>This is a short, timed quiz about the US National Park 
                            System. The user has five minutes to answer ten questions, 
                            after which the quiz is graded and a message is displayed 
                            based off of how the user did. Give it a try and test your 
                            knowledge!

                        <h4>How It Works</h4>
                        <p>The quiz itself is an array that contains an object for each 
                            question. Within those objects, a string acts as the question 
                            and has a corresponding array of answers. When the users starts 
                            the quiz, a function runs that renders all of the questions to 
                            the page dynamically and a timer begins. After the submit button 
                            is clicked, the timer stops and the user's guesses are saved to a 
                            variable and checked against the correct answers. For every 
                            correct answer, 1 is added to the user's score. Depending on the 
                            user's final score, the app will render one of three possible 
                            messages reflecting how the user did as well as display their 
                            total.
                        </p>

                            <p>The Psychic Game is a simple JavaScript game where the 
                                user must try to guess the letter that the computer is 
                                thinking of. If the user is able to correctly guess the 
                                letter within nine tries, a win is added to their score 
                                and the game resets. If they fail to guess the correct 
                                letter, a loss is added to their score.
                            </p>

                            <div class="text-center">
                                <img class="modal-image img-fluid" src="Images/Psychic-game-example.png">
                            </div>

                            <p>The game works by having the computer choose a letter 
                                from an array using Math.random() and saving that letter 
                                to a variable. Then, the computer listens for a keystroke 
                                and compares the key that was pressed to the letter that 
                                was previously saved. If the two are a match, a win is added, 
                                the user guess count resets, the array displaying previous 
                                guesses is cleared, and the computer picks a new number. If 
                                they are not, the user's guess is pushed into an array that 
                                is displayed on screen and one guess is subtracted from their 
                                remaining guesses. When the user's remaining guesses equals 
                                zero, a loss is added, the user guess array is cleared, the 
                                user guess count is reset to nine, and the computer picks a 
                                new letter.
